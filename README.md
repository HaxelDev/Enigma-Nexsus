# Enigma-Nexsus

Welcome to the Enigma-Nexsus Repository!

## Installation

First you need to install Haxe and HaxeFlixel.
1. [Install Haxe 4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/) (Download 4.2.5 instead of 4.1.5, seriously stop using Haxe 4.1.5, it misses a lot of stuffs)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) after downloading Haxe.

Second, you need to install the additional libraries, a fully updated list will be in `Project.xml` in the project root. Here's the list of libraries that you need to install:
```
flixel
flixel-addons
flixel-ui
```
Type `haxelib install [library]` for each of those libs, so like: `haxelib install flixel`.
You should have everything ready for compiling the game! Follow the guide below to continue!

## Mod Support
